Code Refactoring Assignment - Homework Task 1

For this Homework Assignment, I have refactored the existing HTML and CSS files
This was done to ensure that both files meet the current standards and also meet accessibility requirements.
My approach in doing so was to first 'clean up' the CSS file such as to ensure that the layout and designed elements of the page remain unchanged, leaving it looking the way I found it.
After I had re-organised the CSS, I went through the HTML file and updated the relevant tags and added attributes such as to ensure the HTML was meeting the current standards.
